# Zirconium

A learning project for the Zig programming language.

## Overview

Zirconium is a repository dedicated to learning and practicing the Zig programming language. This project contains examples, exercises, and experiments to explore Zig's features and paradigms.

## About Zig

Zig is a general-purpose programming language designed for robustness, optimality, and maintainability. It emphasizes:

- Manual memory management with safety
- Compile-time code execution
- First-class error handling
- Minimal runtime overhead

## Project Goals

- Understand Zig's syntax and core concepts
- Practice memory management patterns
- Explore standard library functionality
- Build practical applications

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Zig compiler installed (latest version recommended)
